# String arguments

There are three types of arguments that return Java's `String` object. Each have their own unique set of features which make them suitable for specific needs.

-----

## String argument

The `StringArgument` class is used to represent a single word. These words **can only contain alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z and 0-9), and the underscore character**.

Accepted `StringArgument` values:

```
Hello
123
hello123
Hello_world
```

Rejected `StringArgument` values:

```
hello@email.com
yesn't
```

<div class="example">

### Examples of StringArgument uses:

* Entering strings to identify offline players

</div>

-----

## Text argument

The `TextArgument` acts similar to any String in Java. These can be single words, like the `StringArgument`, or have additional characters (e.g. spaces, symbols) **if surrounded by quotes**. To type quotation marks, you can use `\"` (as similar to Java) to escape these special characters.

Accepted `TextArgument` values:

```
hello
"hello world!"
"hello@gmail.com"
"this has \" <<-- speech marks! "
```

Rejected `TextArgument` values:

```
hello world
私
"speech marks: ""
```

<div class="example">


### Examples of TextArgument uses:

* Editing the contents of a sign
* A command that requires multiple text arguments (say, username and password?)

</div>

## Greedy string argument

> **Greedy Arguments:**
>
> The `GreedyStringArgument`, similar to the `ChatArgument` uses the entire argument array from its current position. This means that it never ends, therefore if it is used, it must be the last element of your `List` of arguments.
>
> For example, if you have a command `/message <message> <target>`, it would not be able to determine where the message ends and the `<target>` argument begins.
>
> If a `GreedyStringArgument` or `ChatArgument` is not declared at the end of the `List` of arguments, or multiple of these arguments are used in the same `List`, the CommandAPI throws a `GreedyArgumentException`.

The `GreedyStringArgument` takes the `TextArgument` a step further. **Any characters and symbols are allowed** and quotation marks are not required.

### Example - Messaging command

Say we have a simple message command of the following form:

```mccmd
/message <target> <message>
```

This would be ideal for a greedy string, since it can consume all text after the player's name:

```java
{{#include ../../CommandAPI/commandapi-core/src/test/java/Examples.java:greedystringarguments}}
```

Any text entered after the `<target>` argument would be sent to the player. For example, the command could be used as follows:

```
/message Skepter This is some incredibly long string with "symbols" and $p3c!aL characters~
```

Note how this only works if the greedy string argument is _at the end_. If, say, the command was `/message <message> <target>`, it would not be able to determine where the `<message>` argument ends and the `<target>` argument begins.

</div>

<div class="example">

### Examples of GreedyStringArgument uses:

- A messaging/whisper command (as shown in the example above)
- A mailing command
- Any command involving lots of text, such as a command to write the contents of a book
- Any command which involves an unreasonable/unknown amount of arguments
- Any command where you want to parse arguments similar to how regular Bukkit would
