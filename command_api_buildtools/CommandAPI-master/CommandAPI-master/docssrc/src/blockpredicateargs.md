# Block predicate arguments

The `BlockPredicateArgument` is used to represent a "test" for Minecraft blocks. This can consist of tags, such as the ones listed [here on the MinecraftWiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tag#Blocks), or individual blocks. If a block matches the tag or block, then the predicate is satisfied.

For example, if we were to use the predicate `#leaves`, then the following blocks will be satisfied by that predicate: `jungle_leaves`, `oak_leaves`, `spruce_leaves`, `dark_oak_leaves`, `acacia_leaves`, `birch_leaves`.

When used, this argument must be casted to a `Predicate<Block>`. As with other similar arguments with parameterized types, you can ignore Java's unchecked cast type safety warning.

### Example - Replacing specific blocks in a radius

Say you want to replace blocks in a given radius. To do this, we'll use the following command structure:

```mccmd
/replace <radius> <fromBlock> <toBlock>
```

Of course, we could simply use a `BlockStateArgument` or even an `ItemStackArgument` as our `<fromBlock>` in order to get the material to replace, but the block predicate argument provides a test for a given block, which if satisfied, allows certain code to be executed. 

First, we declare our arguments. We want to use the `BlockPredicateArgument` since it also allows us to use Minecraft tags to identify blocks, as well as individual blocks. We then use `BlockStateArgument` to set the block to a given type. The `BlockStateArgument` also allows the user to provide any block data (e.g. contents of a chest or a stair's orientation).

```java
{{#include ../../CommandAPI/commandapi-core/src/test/java/Examples.java:blockpredicatearguments}}
```

We then register our `/replace` command. First, we parse the arguments making sure to cast to `Predicate<Block>` and `BlockData` (and not `BlockState`). After that, we use a few simple for loops to find the blocks within a radius sphere from the player.

In our most nested loop, we can then check if the block meets the requirements of our predicate. This is simply performed using `predicate.test(block)`, and if satisfied, we can set the block's type.

Lastly, we register our command as normal using the `register()` method.

```java
{{#include ../../CommandAPI/commandapi-core/src/test/java/Examples.java:blockpredicatearguments2}}
```
