# Afterword

> **Developer's Note:**
>
> Congratulations on making it to the end of the documentation! I hope it was easy to understand everything ... I feel like it's a bit content heavy.
>
> This project is by far my most worked on and probably the project I'm most proud of. You can read about the creation of the CommandAPI in my blog post [here](https://www.jorelsblog.co.uk/Creating-the-CommandAPI/).
>
> I'd like to give credit to all of the people that have opened issues on GitHub, that have truly made it what it is now. In particular, I'd like to thank:
> - **Combustible** - My #1 supporter who motivated me to keep this project alive after its release
> - **DerpNerb** - Giving me the idea to change this to a Maven project has made the CommandAPI that much more accessible for everyone
> - **Draycia** - Suggesting that I put CommandSender objects inside DynamicSuggestedStringArguments allow that argument to be that much more powerful
> - **HielkeMinecraft** - Improving the LocationArgument class, adding results and successes for commandsd and being a great bug reporter in general
> - **i509VCB** - Generally a really good bug spotter. Discovered a severe bug that made libraries depending on the CommandAPI depend on Brigadier
> - **Tinkot** - Gave a review of the CommandAPI on its spigot page. This motivated me to fix a 6 month old bug
>
> I never really expected more than 5 or so people to use this API, so it was truly an exciting time creating this for everyone - seeing everyone's responses, issues and problems helped me keep going.
>
> In short, thank you, and everyone else that helped make the commandAPI what it is.
